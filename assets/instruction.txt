║ In Squadro, each player has 5 pieces, and the goal is to get all your pieces to  ║
║ the opposite side and back.                                                      ║
║                                                                                  ║
║ Player 1 (starting on the left side of the board):                               ║
║ - Moves pieces to the right (→) along their row.                                 ║
║ - Once a piece reaches the far right corner, it reverses direction and moves to  ║
║   the left (←) to return home.                                                   ║
║                                                                                  ║
║ Player 2 (starting on the top side of the board):                                ║
║ - Moves pieces downward (↓) along their column.                                  ║
║ - Once a piece reaches the bottom corner, it reverses direction and moves upward ║
║   (↑) to return to its starting position.                                        ║
║                                                                                  ║
║ The game alternates turns between Player 1 and Player 2. On each turn, a player  ║
║ selects one of their pieces to move.                                             ║
║                                                                                  ║
║                          📦 Piece Selection 📦                                   ║
║ - Players select a piece by choosing a number between [1-5],                     ║
║   corresponding to the piece’s position.                                         ║
║ - The selected piece moves based on its current direction                        ║
║   (either towards the goal or back to the starting side).                        ║
║                                                                                  ║
║                         🛠 Movement Rules 🛠                                       ║
║ - Each piece has a predefined movement speed, representing how many spaces it    ║
║   moves in a turn.                                                               ║
║ - When a piece reaches its goal (far side of the board),                         ║
║   its movement speed changes as it reverses direction.                           ║
║                                                                                  ║
║ The first player to get all of their pieces to the opposite side                 ║
║ and back to the starting position wins.                                          ║
║                                                                                  ║
