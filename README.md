# Introduction


## 🎲 General Instructions for Squadro 🎲


In Squadro, each player has 5 pieces, and the goal is to get all your pieces to
the opposite side and back.

Player 1 (starting on the left side of the board):
- Moves pieces to the right (→) along their row.
- Once a piece reaches the far right corner, it reverses direction and moves to
the left (←) to return home.

Player 2 (starting on the top side of the board):
- Moves pieces downward (↓) along their column.
- Once a piece reaches the bottom corner, it reverses direction and moves upward 
(↑) to return to its starting position.

The game alternates turns between Player 1 and Player 2. On each turn, a player
selects one of their pieces to move.
## 📦 Piece Selection 📦 
- Players select a piece by choosing a number between [1-5], 
corresponding to the piece’s position.
- The selected piece moves based on its current direction
(either towards the goal or back to the starting side).

## 🛠 Movement Rules 🛠 
- Each piece has a predefined movement speed, representing how many spaces it
moves in a turn.
- When a piece reaches its goal (far side of the board),
its movement speed changes as it reverses direction. 

The first player to get all of their pieces to the opposite side
and back to the starting position wins.
